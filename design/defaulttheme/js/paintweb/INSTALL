You don't need to install this Web application. Just open a demo from the demos 
folder in your Web browser. For documentation please check the API reference and 
the wiki pages published at http://code.google.com/p/paintweb.

Repackaging PaintWeb
====================

Important folders:

  - src/ - holds the source code spread across multiple files.
  - build/ - holds the packaged build.
  - scripts/ - holds scripts used for packaging.

If you make changes to files in the src/ folder you may want to repackage 
PaintWeb - regenerate the build folder.

Prerequisites
-------------

  - PHP 5+

  - Makefile support. Usually, you get this really easily and quickly on any 
  Linux distribution. Tested with Ubuntu.

  - Java VM.

  - YUI Compressor. This is used for compressing JavaScript and CSS files. Get 
  it from:

      http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/

  - jsdoc-toolkit. This is used for generating the API reference documentation 
  based on the source code. Get it from:

      http://jsdoctoolkit.org/

Make sure you unpack jsdoc-toolkit and yuicompressor and you have both scripts 
working fine with your Java VM.

Run the following command in your PaintWeb folder:
  make config

Now you have config-local.mk. Open it and make sure:

  - BIN_PHP points to your PHP binary.
  - FOLDER_YUIC points to your YUI Compressor unpacked folder.
  - FOLDER_JSDOCT points to your jsdoc-toolkit unpacked folder.

Now you are ready!


Run make
--------

To generate the build folder run:
  make

You will have build/paintweb.src.js for debugging purposes.

To generate the API reference documentation run:
  make docs

To get an archived PaintWeb package as a release simply run:
  make release

That will give you a file like paintweb-0.9.tar.bz2. The version number is 
determined automatically.

You can also make a snapshot of PaintWeb:
  make snapshot

Snapshots have the build date included. For example 
paintweb-0.9-20091010.tar.bz2.

If you want to make a custom build of PaintWeb for Moodle 1.9 or Moodle 2.0 then 
run:
  make moodle19
  or
  make moodle20

This will make sure that the Moodle extension for PaintWeb is included in the 
package.

To generate a tags file from the PaintWeb source code run:
  make tags

That's about all. Enjoy!
