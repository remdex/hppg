This folder holds scripts used for integration PaintWeb into Moodle 1.9 and 
Moodle 2.0.

=== Files ===

config.json - holds the PaintWeb configuration when it runs in Moodle.

gen_moodlelang.php - allows you to convert PaintWeb JSON language files to 
Moodle PHP language files.

gen_paintweblang.php - allows you to convert Moodle PHP language files to 
PaintWeb JSON language files.

imagesave19.php - implements the image save operation of PaintWeb, for Moodle 
1.9.

imagesave20.php - implements the image save operation of PaintWeb, for Moodle 
2.0, using the new File API

imageview19.php - implements an image file serving mechanism for Moodle 1.9.  
Images saved are stored in the Moodle data dir which is not accessible from the 
browser, thus this script is needed to allow users to view such images from the 
data dir.

lang.json.php - the JSON language file loaded by PaintWeb in Moodle. This is 
a PHP script which generates the JSON dynamically based on the Moodle PHP 
language files.

moodle19-paintweb.patch - the patch you need to apply to Moodle 1.9 to get 
PaintWeb working. This is a patch you can apply once you have Moodle 1.9 and 
TinyMCE 3. This holds the differences *only* for the Moodle core files.

moodle20-paintweb.patch - the patch you need to apply to Moodle 2.0 to get 
PaintWeb working. This is a patch you can apply once you have Moodle 2.0. This 
holds the differences *only* for the Moodle core files.


=== Usage in Moodle 1.9 ===

If you have no experience with Git, here's what you need to do:

# Get the Moodle 1.9 code with PaintWeb integrated
  git clone git://repo.or.cz/moodle/mihaisucan.git ~/src/moodle
  cd ~/src/moodle
  git checkout -b mdl19-paintweb origin/mdl19-paintweb

You need to add the following in your Moodle 1.9 configuration file 
(config.php):

  $CFG->defaulthtmleditor = 'tinymce';
  $CFG->tinymcePaintWeb = true;
# The PaintWeb folder used for storing images inside the Moodle data folder.
  $CFG->paintwebImagesFolder = 'paintweb-images';


=== Usage in Moodle 2.0 ===

If you have no experience with Git, here's what you need to do:

# Get the Moodle 2.0 code with PaintWeb integrated:
  git clone git://repo.or.cz/moodle/mihaisucan.git ~/src/moodle
  cd ~/src/moodle
  git checkout -b mdl20-paintweb origin/mdl20-paintweb

There's nothing to configure in your config.php. PaintWeb is ready to use.


Good luck!
